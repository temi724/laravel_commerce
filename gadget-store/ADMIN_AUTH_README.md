# Admin Authorization for Product Management

## Overview
I've successfully implemented admin authorization for product creation, editing, and deletion in your Laravel commerce application. Here's what has been implemented:

## Features Added

### 1. Admin Authentication Middleware (`AdminAuth`)
- **Location**: `app/Http/Middleware/AdminAuth.php`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Checks for `Admin-ID` in request headers or `admin_id` in request parameters
  - Validates that the admin exists in the database
  - Adds authenticated admin to request for use in controllers
  - Returns 401 error if admin is not authenticated

### 2. Protected Product Operations
- **CREATE**: `POST /api/products` - Requires admin authentication
- **UPDATE**: `PUT/PATCH /api/products/{id}` - Requires admin authentication  
- **DELETE**: `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Requires admin authentication
- **READ**: `GET /api/products` and `GET /api/products/{id}` - Public access (no authentication required)

### 3. Admin Logging
All protected operations now log which admin performed the action:
- Product creation logs admin name and ID
- Product updates log admin name and ID
- Product deletion logs admin name, ID, and deleted product name

### 4. Enhanced API Responses
Protected endpoints now return additional information:
- Admin name who performed the action
- Success messages
- Better error handling

## Usage Examples

### Public Access (No Authentication Required)
```bash
# Get all products
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products"

# Get specific product
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}"
```

### Admin-Protected Operations
```bash
# Create product (requires Admin-ID header)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Admin-ID: 68b74ba7002cda59000d800c" \
  -d '{
    "product_name": "New Product",
    "price": 299.99,
    "in_stock": true
  }'

# Update product (requires Admin-ID header)
curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Admin-ID: 68b74ba7002cda59000d800c" \
  -d '{
    "product_name": "Updated Product",
    "price": 399.99
  }'

# Delete product (requires Admin-ID header)
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}" \
  -H "Admin-ID: 68b74ba7002cda59000d800c"
```

## Available Admin IDs for Testing
```
- 68b74ba7002cda59000d800c (Adelia Conroy)
- 68b74ba700d831ea0006e8e9 (Corine Sipes)  
- 68b74ba700f379c8009827e1 (Archibald Windler)
- 68b74e4c005650700034f570 (Braden Mayert)
```

## Error Responses

### Unauthorized Access (401)
```json
{
  "error": "Admin authentication required",
  "message": "Please provide Admin-ID in headers or admin_id in request"
}
```

### Invalid Admin (401)
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid admin credentials", 
  "message": "Admin not found"
}
```

## Security Features
1. **MongoDB-like ObjectIds**: All admin IDs use secure 24-character hex strings
2. **Middleware Protection**: Routes are protected at the middleware level
3. **Admin Verification**: Each request verifies admin exists in database
4. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged for security tracking
5. **Selective Protection**: Only destructive operations require authentication

## To Test the Implementation
1. Start the Laravel server: `php artisan serve`
2. Use the Admin IDs listed above in the `Admin-ID` header
3. Try accessing protected endpoints with and without authentication
4. Check the Laravel logs to see admin action logging

The authorization is now fully implemented and ready for use!
